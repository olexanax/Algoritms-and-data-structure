## Selection Sort

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Average    | O(n^2)       |
| Best       | O(n^2)       |
| Worst      | O(n^2)       |
| Space      | O(1)         |


Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. 
The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the desired order) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region. 
This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. 
Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, making it less efficient than more advanced sorting algorithms for large datasets.
