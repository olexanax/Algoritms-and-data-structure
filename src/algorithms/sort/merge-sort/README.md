## Merge Sort

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Average    | O(n log n)   |
| Best       | O(n log n)   |
| Worst      | O(n log n)   |
| Space      | O(n)         |



Merge Sort is a classic sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort items in an array. The algorithm splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.
