## Bubble Sort

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Average    | O(n^2)       |
| Best       | O(n)         |
| Worst      | O(n^2)       |
| Space      | O(1)         |



Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements in a list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. During each iteration, the largest (or smallest, depending on the sorting order) element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

The main idea is to traverse the list multiple times, comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if necessary. This process continues until all elements are sorted.

This algorithm is named "Bubble Sort" because during each iteration, larger elements "bubble up" to the top of the list, resembling small "bubbles" rising to the surface of a liquid.

If an array is almost sorted, the bubble sort algorithm can have better performance because it will simply traverse the array without making any changes if no exchanges occur during the first iteration. This leads to a time complexity of approximately O(n) for already sorted data.
