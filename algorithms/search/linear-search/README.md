## Linear search

| Complexity | Big O        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Average    | O(n)         |
| Best       | O(1)         |
| Worst      | O(n)         |
| Space      | O(1)         |

Linear search sequentially checks each element of an array until it finds the target element or reaches the end. It has a time complexity of O(n), where "n" is the number of elements in the array.
